    <h2> Introduction :</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Snooper:</dt>
                <dd>The infamous Snooper also known as Cooper was once found deep in the Amazon jungle, playing Skibidi Toilet with the Huzz. Life was tough in the jungle, but he did his best to provide for the gang.

As time passed, he realized that life had more meaning than just playing Skibidi Rizz with the Huzz and drinking Grimace Shake. Now, all he had to do was make the best decision of his life: move to the great city of New York, where he would finally meet his online goon buddy, Dooper.
                <dt>Dooper:</dt>
                    <dd>Dooper was a proud member of the legendary Rizz Raiders gang. His life goal? To reach Rizz Level 999 and pull a gyat from the Bronx. But for now, he was just a rookie,a wannabe rizzler who’d had a few lucky nights with the street-level Huzz. Little did he know, once Snooper joined the gang, everything would change. The Bronx baddies would be running toward him and the Bruzz like pigeons to breadcrumbs.

Life was about to flip upside down but there was one thing standing between Snooper and the great soil of the USA. Snooper was Mexican… and he had no documents.
